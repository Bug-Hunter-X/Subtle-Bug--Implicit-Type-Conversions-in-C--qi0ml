# Subtle Bug: Implicit Type Conversions in C#

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to implicit type conversions in C#. The code showcases how implicit conversions, while convenient, can lead to unexpected behavior or errors if not carefully considered, particularly within complex scenarios involving overloaded operators or custom classes.  The `bug.cs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cs` offers a corrected and improved version.

## Problem
The `bug.cs` file contains a `MyClass` that overloads implicit conversion operators. Although it works for simple cases, it can become problematic if used with other mathematical or logical operators in a way not accounted for in the class definition. In these cases, unexpected results, or even exceptions can be seen.
